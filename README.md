Learning the ropes.

Hello everyone,

I live in a small town in Missouri, but I have big ideas.  I study astrology, history, physics, my ancestry and heritage, languages and geology.  This is my newest venture and I will put 110% into learning it.  I have big ideas to implement and I greatly appreciate the opportunity and the expertise to be found here.

Michelle :)
